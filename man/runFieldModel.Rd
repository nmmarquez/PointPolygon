\title{Run a Model and Estimate Underlying Field From Point and Polygon Data}
\usage{
runFieldModel(field, pointDF = NULL, polyDF = NULL, moption = 0,
  verbose = FALSE, symbolic = TRUE, control = list(eval.max = 10000,
  iter.max = 10000), rWidth = NULL, priors = FALSE, mcmc = FALSE,
  AprojPoly = NULL, shape3 = NULL, start = list(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{field}{field object which simulated underlying data}

\item{pointDF}{data simulated from samplePoints}

\item{polyDF}{data simulated from samplePolygns}

\item{moption}{int, intger indicating how polygon data should be estimated 0
is by mixed model approximation, 1 is by redistribution, 2 is by Utazi
approach, 3 is by riemman approximation, 4 is ignoring polygon data,
5 is if all data was known.}

\item{verbose}{logical, print model fitting information}

\item{symbolic}{logical, use metas reordering in model fitting}

\item{control}{list, control list passed to nlminb}

\item{rWidth}{int, only used in moption 2 to build besag prior}

\item{priors}{logical, default FALSE Should priors be evaluated for top level
parameters.}

\item{mcmc}{logical, default FALSE Should model be fit with MCMC. Not
compatible with moption 2.}

\item{AprojPoly}{sparseMatrix, sparse matrix with population weight information for polygons.}

\item{shape3}{shape to build the adjaceny matrix for when moption == 2}

\item{start}{starting points of parameters.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to pass to tmbstan}
}
\value{
List of fitted model objects.
}
\description{
Run a model and estimate underlying latent and probability
field from point and polygon data using TMB.
