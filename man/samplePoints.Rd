\title{Take Point Observations from a spatial field.}
\usage{
samplePoints(field, N, M, replace = TRUE, times = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{field}{field object which simulated underlying data}

\item{N}{int 1, Number of points to simulate}

\item{M}{int, Number of trials for each point either 1 or N long}

\item{replace}{logical, replace pixel probabilities in sampling?}

\item{times}{vector of int, times to sample from}

\item{...}{further argumnets for compatibility}
}
\value{
data.frame with observation number, number of trials, and the id
of the pixel that the trail took place in.
}
\description{
Takes binomial trials from a probability field created by 
simField randomly from points on the field.
}
