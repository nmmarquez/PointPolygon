\title{Take Observations from Polygons within the latent field}
\usage{
samplePolygons(field, N, M, p = 1, polygonList = NULL, rWidth = NULL,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{field}{field object which simulated underlying data}

\item{N}{int, number of points for each polygon}

\item{M}{int, Number of trials for each point}

\item{p}{numeric >0 & <=1, percentage of polygons sampled}

\item{polygonList}{list, list of polygons to sample from}

\item{rWidth}{integer, instead of using a polygon list divide the original
bounding box into approximately equal sized squares with rWidth number 
squares along the x axis.}

\item{...}{further argumnets for compatibility}
}
\value{
data.frame with observation number, number of trials, and the id
of the pixel that the trail took place in.
}
\description{
Takes binomial trials from a probability field created by 
simField randomly from the field where each observation takes place within
a given polygon and is representative of that polygon.
}
