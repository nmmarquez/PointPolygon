# Background

- For countries without comprehensive Vital Registration data accurate use of survey data is essential for estimating child mortality
- Data come to us at different spatial resolutions and if we believe the true underlying data generating process is continuous then administrative data is problematic for traditional geospatial models
- How can we effectively/accurately incorporate different spatial resolution data into geospatial models

# Data Example

# Data Example
- Historically incomplete VR for child births and deaths
- Number of surveys on complete birth history (CBH)
- DHS 2007 & 2013: Complete Spatial information given for CBH
- MICS 2014: Cluster location removed for CBH know only up to stratification

# Previous Approaches

- Golding et al 2017 (Resampling)
    - Pros: Uses all available data, applicable for all contexts
    - Cons: May distort the estimation of spatial correlation
- Utazi et al 2018 (RHS Integration with ICAR)
    - Pros: Uses all available data, applicable for all contexts
    - Cons: Built in ecological fallacy and strange non linearity
- Wilson et al 2018 (MCMC in INLA)
    - Pros: Correctly captures the data generating process
    - Cons: Slow to implement and potential privacy issues
- No substantive cross comparison between models evaluating performance

# New Proposal: Mixture Model

$$Y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(p_{s_i, t_i}, N_i) \\ \text{logit}(p_{s_i, t_i}) = \boldsymbol{\beta \cdot X_{s_i, t_i}} + \omega(s_i, t_i) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega} \sim \mathcal{GP}(\boldsymbol{0}, \mathcal{M} \otimes\text{AR1}) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega}~\dot \sim~ \text{GMRF}(\boldsymbol{0}, Q^\mathcal{M} \otimes Q^\text{AR1}) \\ \kappa \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \tau \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \rho \sim \text{Logit Normal}(0, 10)$$

---

# New Proposal: Mixture Model

$$Y^\star_i ~\dot \sim ~ \begin{cases} \text{Binomial}(p_{s_{j_1}, t_i}, N_i) \times q_{s_{j_1}}\\ \vdots \\ \text{Binomial}(p_{s_{j_J}, t_i}, N_i) \times q_{s_{j_J}} \\ \end{cases} \text{for } j \in \mathcal{A}_i \\ \text{logit}(p_{s_j, t_i}) = \boldsymbol{\beta \cdot X_{s_j, t_i}} + \omega(s_j, t_i) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega}~\dot \sim~ \text{GMRF}(\boldsymbol{0}, Q^\mathcal{M} \otimes Q^\text{AR1}) \\ \kappa \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \tau \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \rho \sim \text{Logit Normal}(0, 10)$$

---

# New Proposal Alternative: Riemann

$$Y^\star_i ~\dot \sim ~ \text{Binomial}(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} p_{s_{j}, t_i} \times q_{s_{j}, t_i}, N_i)\\ \text{logit}(p_{s_j, t_i}) = \boldsymbol{\beta \cdot X_{s_j, t_i}} + \omega(s_j, t_i) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega}~\dot \sim~ \text{GMRF}(\boldsymbol{0}, Q^\mathcal{M} \otimes Q^\text{AR1}) \\ \kappa \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \tau \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \rho \sim \text{Logit Normal}(0, 10)$$

# Model Requirements
- Covariate space for entire area must be known  
- Must have a good sampling frame of population for time of sample
    - If known use enumeration areas
    - Population Raster is sufficient
- Relatively Large RAM requirements

---

# Model Comparison Framework: Simulated Field and Sampling
- Simulate a 2D Matern covariance process GP as the spatial field (1x1 grid)  
- Add in a covariate to the field which either is  
    - Spatially clustered  
    - Spatially correlated  
    - At random
- Sample from the field with known location  
- Sample from the field with unknown location up to a polygon

# Model Comparison Framework: Evaluation
 - RMSE of the probability field
$\frac{\text{RMSE}_{\text{Utazi}} - \text{RMSE}_{\text{Model}}}{\text{RMSE}_{\text{Utazi}}}$
 - Coverage of CI across the field
 - Bias
 - Bias for Dissimilarity Measure
 - Breakdown results by spatial range and covariate types

# Simulation DR Context

- Simulate spatial-temporal field over 6 years across the DR ~(5x5km grid)
- Sample using DHS 2013 and MICS 2014 location information
- Simulate cluster locations for MICS within known stratification (Region/urbanicity)
- DHS: 370 clusters with 3256 person-years of data
- Mics:  684 clusters of data with ~25,000 person years of data
- No Utazi model

# Conclusion
- New model provides significant improvement over IHME resampling
- Most tested models offer some improvement over resampling
- Reduction of standard errors compared to ignoring data (35% at province)
- Cost of implementation for mixture model is high (runtime & RAM)  
- Riemann model offers a compromise in performance and resources  

---

# Limitations
- No model miss-specification tests  
- Unclear how different results are when applied to actual data
- Should test other countries  
- Need to vary temporal auto correlation

class: inverse, center, middle
