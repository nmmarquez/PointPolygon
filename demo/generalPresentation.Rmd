# Background

---

# Child Mortality and the Millenium Development Goals

- "... the Persistence of disparities in infant mortality rates throughout this century, mirroring the persistence of larger social and economic inequalities in the United States" (Gormaker & Wise 1997)
- Child mortality as an indicator for
    - Maternal health
    - Access to care
    - General public health
    - Morbidity and early life adversity
- Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
    - Reduce child mortality by two thirds

---

# The Lasting Effects of MDGs

- Comparative health-systems studies (Horton 2006)
    - The importance of strengthening health systems
    - Evidence based implementation
    - Strong importance on understanding data landscape
- Countdown to 2015 (Victoria et al 2016)
    - The importance of multiple stakeholders in monitoring processes
    - Linking interventions to health improvements
    - Planning for future goals

---
# Limitations of the National Context and Inequality

- Country level studies mask variation within the country (Hosseinpoor 2016)
    - Need for unmasking geographic differences in health
    - Deploy equity oriented interventions
- Recent studies point to growing levels of health inequalities by sub-national measures
    - Rising inequality in United States county level mortality (Dwyer-Lindgren 2017)
    - Differential gains in Sub-Saharan Africa under five mortality (Burke 2016)

# Precision Public Health

"These limitations notwithstanding, the general findings that changes in under-5 mortality and clustering frequently transcended boundaries and were more responsive to local factors than to national factors are important and borne out by other evidence." (Bhutta 2016)

"By more accurately detecting, identifying, and tracking unique traits in subpopulations, subgroups, or even communities, we can respond with greater precision" (Desmond-Hellmann 2016)

---
# Goals: Spatial Analysis of Under 5 Mortality

- Estimate Under 5 mortality at spatially granular levels  
- Estimate time series of mortality trends to provide context
- Estimate age specific patterns for potential intervention practices 

---
# Difficulties in Small Area Estimation 
- How to appropriately model small area estimates of mortality is not well agreed upon  
- Complete linked vital registration systems are most often not available  
    - This is especially true for the global south  
- Aprropriate survey data, geotagged data, is not always available  
- __Whether to ignore or harmonize sub-par data, data that is not geotagged, in the modeling process__  

---
# DHS and MICS Studies
- United States Agency for International Development / UNICEF funded
- Monitor changes in health in developing countries
    - Countries that do not have comprehensive registration systems
- Collect data on a number of health indicators including CBH of women in households
- Relatively small portion of the data is geolocated
    - 40% of person years observed are geolocated
    - 60% are representative of some national/subnational level
    - Data is still collected in similar survey scheme

---
# Proposal
- Introduce a new method for incorporating clustered obscured data in spatial analysis
- Compare against gold standard of knowing where data comes from
- Compare against ignoring the data completely
- Compare against previously stated methods
- Comparison framework
    - Simulate spatio-temporal field of underlying probabilities  
    - Sample from the field at random  
    - Obscure locations for some samples representative of a particular area  
    - Validate on error and coverage metrics  
    - Holdout framework for validating model
- Situate model results against other estimates of under-5 mortality

# Method

---
# Data Collection Process for MICS/DHS
- Two stage sampling process
- Divide country of concern into stratifications
    - Administrative areas
    - Urban/Rural
- Using enumeration areas as a frame sample areas within a stratification
- Sample households from within the enumeration areas selected
- Usually not sampled at random and weights are given to samples
- Weights reflect representation of a given stratified area
- CBH give us retrospective samples

---
# An Example Case: Dominican Republic
- Historically incomplete VR for child births and deaths
- Number of surveys on complete birth history (CBH)
- DHS 2007 & 2013: Complete Spatial information given for CBH
- MICS 2014: Cluster location removed for CBH know only up to stratification

# Traditional Spatial Modeling Approach
- Continuous model of underlying spatial risk
- Allows for arbitrary aggregation to administrative levels

$$Y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(p_{s_i, t_i}, N_i) \\ \text{logit}(p_{s_i, t_i}) = \boldsymbol{\beta \cdot X_{s_i, t_i}} + \omega(s_i, t_i) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega} \sim \mathcal{GP}(\boldsymbol{0}, \mathcal{M} \otimes\text{AR1}) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega}~\dot \sim~ \text{GMRF}(\boldsymbol{0}, Q^\mathcal{M} \otimes Q^\text{AR1}) \\ \kappa \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \tau \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \rho \sim \text{Logit Normal}(0, 10)$$

# Model Requirements
- Covariate space for entire area must be known  
- Must have a good sampling frame of population for time of sample
    - If known use enumeration areas
    - Population Raster is sufficient
- Relatively Large RAM requirements

---

# Model Comparison Framework: Simulated Field and Sampling
- Simulate a 2D Matern covariance process GP as the spatial field (1x1 grid)  
- Add in a covariate to the field which either is  
    - Spatially clustered  
    - Spatially correlated  
    - At random
- Sample from the field with known location  
- Sample from the field with unknown location up to a polygon

---
# Previous Approaches

- Golding et al 2017 (Resampling)
    - Pros: Uses all available data, applicable for all contexts
    - Cons: May distort the estimation of spatial correlation
- Utazi et al 2018 (RHS Integration with ICAR)
    - Pros: Uses all available data, applicable for all contexts
    - Cons: Built in ecological fallacy and strange non linearity
- Wilson et al 2018 (MCMC in INLA)
    - Pros: Correctly captures the data generating process
    - Cons: Slow to implement and potential privacy issues
- No substantive cross comparison between models evaluating performance

# Data Application

# Child Mortality Conext

- We want to model not only the time and space process but they age process as well  
- Need to expand on the model to account for differences
- Model 1: Multiple survey soures to account for 
- Model 2: Possible space indpendent (national level) age specific temporal effects  
- Model 3: Account for the possibility of excess variance  
- Test each model using one of three masked data incorporation techniques  
    - Ignore  
    - Mixture  
    - Resmaple
- Evaluate each model by holding out one year of data and calculating likelihood of hold out from model.

# Child Mortality Context

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_a(\boldsymbol{s}_i, t) &\sim& \text{Binomial}\left[ ~N_a(\boldsymbol{s}_i , t), p_a(\boldsymbol{s}_i , t)~ \right] \nonumber \\
\text{logit}\left[~ p_a(\boldsymbol{s}_i, t)~\right] &=&
\underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{
 \beta_a + 
\gamma I( \boldsymbol{s}_i \in \mbox{ urban })+
\epsilon_v + u(\boldsymbol{s}_i, t)

# Conclusion
- New model provides significant improvement over IHME resampling
- Most tested models offer some improvement over resampling
- Reduction of standard errors compared to ignoring data (35% at province)
- More accurate than previous approaches both in simulation and OOS contexts  
- Cost of implementation for mixture model is high (runtime & RAM)  
- Riemann model offers a compromise in performance and resources  

---

# Limitations
- No model miss-specification tests  
- Should test other countries  
- Need to vary temporal auto correlation  

---

# Next steps
- Apply to the Dominican Republic dataset (all models)
- Model fit comparison: MCMC and TMB
