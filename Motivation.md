# Why does Point Polygon Matter?  

## Motivating Example with child Mortality  
 - Changes in Under 5 mortality  
 - Proxy for general population health
 - easier to measure  
 - MDGs

# talk about measurement problems  
 - VR  
 - Suerveys  
 - Surviellance  
 - Summary Birth histories vs complete birth histories  

## Helpful Notes for presenting  
 - Remember your units!!! (Including in maps)  
 - maps with geographic outlines  

## How do we evealuate models
 - what is the polict implication???  
 - How is policy implemented?  
 - What are the implications of the uncertainty for different policy decisions?  

## TODO:
 - Test model mis-specification  
 - test temproal autocorrelation range  
 - test when the approx9imation may be poor and when it does pretty well  
 - test reasonable values of U5m as well as single year data 
 - Throw in other measures of variation to examine and test 
 - Relative root mean squared error
 - Turn off multithreads for TMB 
 - Show how different the mixture is from the approximation
